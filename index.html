              <h1>Research</h1>
              <p>
              <h2>Overview</h2> 
              My research centers on the intersection of computer networks, machine learning, and optimization. Specifically, I'm interested in analyzing correlations within heterogeneous networked systems, which consist of diverse devices like robots, sensors, and controllers. My projects aim to harness these device correlations to enhance decision-making processes, such as optimizing bandwidth allocation and data offloading for machine learning models.

              <h2>(New Project!) Large Language Model Selection</h2>
              Language models like ChatGPT and Bard have become integral to our daily lives, yet their performance hinges on user context, training data, and model architecture, which users typically have limited knowledge of. Interactions with these models occur through internet APIs, treating them as black boxes. My project tackles a key question: <b>How can we select the right large language model on the Internet for a specific task? How do we even define tasks of our chatbot conversation?</b> To answer this, I seek to uncover the correlation between model performance and user context of conversation. Finally, I want create a decision-making algorithm for choosing the best model. 

              <h2>Task-aware Data Transmission</h2> 
              In modern networked control systems and machine learning, data from various sources are used for specific tasks. However, data transmission processes like adversarial attacks, anonymization, noise, and compression are often not optimized for the task at hand. These projects aim to study the impact of data transmission on system performance and develop task-specific transmission methods.
              <br> 
              The following projects focus on <b>multi-source data compression</b>, <b>differential privacy</b>, and <b>adversarial attack</b>, correspondingly.

              <h2>Decentralized Data Sharing</h2> 
              <!-- Federated learning (FL) is commonly used to efficiently train neural networks among a group of devices. However, one major restriction of FL is that it only applies to homogeneous neural networks, i.e., networks with identical structure and layers. Thus, my projects focus on how to share raw data, but not gradients, among devices to retrain neural networks, and most importantly, to avoid the previous restriction. Moreover, the projects discuss under network bandwidth constraints, how to share a limited number of valuable data without violating privacy of devices. Topics related to these projects are: out-of-distribution (OoD) detectors, data valuation, active learning, data sanitizing, differential privacy, and distributed optimization.  -->
              These projects aim to improve federated learning (FL), which typically requires all devices to have identical neural network structures. My projects explore sharing raw data, not gradients, among devices to overcome this limitation. Additionally, I focus on challenges related to limited network bandwidth and privacy preservation when sharing valuable data. My work covers topics such as out-of-distribution detection, data valuation, active learning, differential privacy, and distributed optimization.
