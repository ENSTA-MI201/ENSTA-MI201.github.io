              <h1>Research</h1>
              <p>
              <h2>Overview</h2> 
              My research centers on the intersection of multi-agent networks, machine learning, and optimization. 
              Specifically, I'm interested in multi-agent networks, where agents have different views/modalities of data. These agents, which could be robots, sensors, or machine learning models, are designed to share information amongst themselves to fulfill their individual objectives. My projects aim to harness these agents' distinct modalities or characteristics to enhance decision-making processes, such as bandwidth allocation and data sharing for machine learning models.

              <h2>Enhancing Data Transmission Efficiency for Diverse Data Modalities</h2>
              This research thread explores the optimization of data transmission in scenarios where data is derived from various modalities, each offering a unique view or perspective. The aim is to refine the information exchange processes by first identifying the importance of each data modality and then developing transmission strategies that are tailored to the unique objective of each agent. Our methods are tailored to meet the specific requirements of agents for each data type, thereby boosting the efficiency and reliability of systems. 
              <br>
              The upcoming projects concentrate on three key areas: (1) enhanced multi-modal data sharing, (2) implementing differential privacy mechanisms for data sharing, and (3) mitigating the effects of adversarial attacks on false information sharing.

              <h2>(New Project!) Large Language Model Selection</h2>
              Language models like ChatGPT and Bard have become integral to our daily lives, yet their performance hinges on user context, training data, and model architecture, which users typically have limited knowledge of. Interactions with these models occur through internet APIs, treating them as black boxes. My project tackles a key question: <b>How can we select the right large language model on the Internet for a specific task? How do we even define tasks of our chatbot conversation?</b> To answer this, I seek to uncover the correlation between model performance and user context of conversation. Finally, I want create a decision-making algorithm for choosing the best model. 

              <h2>Decentralized Data Sharing</h2> 
              <!-- Federated learning (FL) is commonly used to efficiently train neural networks among a group of devices. However, one major restriction of FL is that it only applies to homogeneous neural networks, i.e., networks with identical structure and layers. Thus, my projects focus on how to share raw data, but not gradients, among devices to retrain neural networks, and most importantly, to avoid the previous restriction. Moreover, the projects discuss under network bandwidth constraints, how to share a limited number of valuable data without violating privacy of devices. Topics related to these projects are: out-of-distribution (OoD) detectors, data valuation, active learning, data sanitizing, differential privacy, and distributed optimization.  -->
              These projects aim to improve federated learning (FL), which typically requires all devices to have identical neural network structures. My projects explore sharing raw data, not gradients, among devices to overcome this limitation. Additionally, I focus on challenges related to limited network bandwidth and privacy preservation when sharing valuable data. My work covers topics such as out-of-distribution detection, data valuation, active learning, differential privacy, and distributed optimization.
